# NestJS Challenge
 
This project was left in a non-working and unfinished state. The endpoint needed to be fixed as it returned an error. 

My task is to ensure a request to /users returns an array of users from users.service.ts.

## Tasks
* Correct TypeScript type annotations
* A /users endpoint accessible via a HTTP GET method which responds with an array of alphabetically sorted users (first then last name)
* Use the getUsers() method in users.service.ts to get the array of users

All of these tasks have been completed.
